On Saturday, April 27, 2019, in room 209 at the University of
Illinois Illini Union, I was part of an College of Engineering
alumni panel to talk with CoE students at a "Milk and Cookies"
event hosted by ESAA (Engineering Student Alumni Ambassadors).

The panelists were given a prepared list of talking points.  The
file `esaa-talk.md` has my answers to those questions.
