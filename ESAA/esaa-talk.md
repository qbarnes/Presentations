1. Tell us a little bit about yourself. What was your college
   experience like?

   I grew up in a little town in Southern Illinois.  My high school
   graduating class was 95.  I came to U of I in the Fall of '81.
   I enrolled in the College of Engineering CS program and that's
   what I graduated with.

   My dorm was PAR, Blais Ground.  I had a great floor, mostly other
   engineers.  We still have get togethers up in the burbs every few
   years.  Last one was just last summer. blaisground.weebly.com

   My first college class ever was CS121 in Greg 100 at 9am.  Much of
   my time at UIUC and my career were set all by the friends I made
   that day by where I just happened to have sat down.  I ended up
   hanging with them through my entire time at college, studying or
   gaming, and then even at jobs after college.


2. Describe your career following graduation, how did UIUC help you
   in this aspect?

   My first full-time job I started before I graduated.  I was working
   out of my apartment.  It was a startup.  I was employee #3.  It was
   make it big or bust.  The founder was in Oregon, the director was in
   Chicago, and the rest of us were UIUC students.  Ten months in, we
   busted.

   I scrambled to find another job.  Ended up at a little company
   here in Champaign with about 40 employees.  They were a military
   subcontractor.  The team I was on was great, but it was not a
   good job.  The company was run by someone who made working there
   difficult.  But while I was there, I got MS-DOS and UNIX device
   driver experience.

   I left there and went to Gould Computer Systems as a UNIX kernel
   engineer.  They were bought by Motorola 3 months after I started.
   Worked at Motorola for 19 years doing compiler and UNIX and Linux
   kernel work.  Motorola closed our site.

   I went from Motorola to Yahoo! doing Linux kernel work for
   production servers.  Verizon bought us last year, but otherwise
   still doing the same work.

   My time at UIUC helped my career in two ways, education and
   contacts.  My first two jobs were through people I met and
   becames friends with at college.  However, the education I
   received was invaluable.

   Every single CS and Math class I took at U of I, through the
   education I gained, helped open a career opportunity for me.
   What of the classes I didn't take?  I don't know how many other
   opportunities passed me by because I passed over not taking more
   Math and CS classes,


3. How has the industry you've chosen changed since you first got
   involved?

   A lot!

   For good and for bad.

   The good first.  Open source software.  Everything I used to
   write and everything everyone else used to write was considered
   proprietary IP and locked down, so everyone was recreating the same
   solutions over and over.  Companies didn't understand open source.
   Being able to have a job that allows me to share ideas and code with
   others has been a huge change for the positive.

   Tools.  The ability to even do source code control, let along having
   collaboration tools like git.  Even doing source code control at all
   was brand new in the 80s.  Mission critical code was often only on
   one hard drive on one person's desk with no backups.

   Now the bad.

   Work environment.  I used to have a personal office with a door I
   could close.  The door was closed meant, "Leave me alone, I'm in the
   zone."  Door open, "Come in with your questions or chat."

   It's been steadily going downhill ever since.  Now I have a 5' desk
   crammed against others with dozens of people in an open office
   environment.  Constant interrupts, conversations, the noise from
   people's cell phones going off with texts and tweets.  There is no
   place to do any work that requires actual concentration.

   The other is the performance of software.  It's gone so much down
   hill since about the late 90s and how terribly slow it has all
   become.

   In the mid-90s I had an Amiga desktop computer with a 25MHz 68040
   processor.  From the point where I flipped its power on, it
   completed its code start hardware diagnostics and initialization,
   spun up its hard disk, loaded the desktop environment with its menu
   bars and icons, ran my initialization scripts and and opened all my
   windows, how long do you think that took?

   3 seconds.  Often my CRT screen had set overnight, it wouldn't have
   warmed up in that time.

   Another example.  How many people here have seen that huge PLATO
   computer terminal display over on the first floor in Siebol?

   In the 70s and 80s, there used to be those terminals all over campus
   and all over the world.  Those terminals used to be connected to a
   CDC Cyber 73 mainframe system here on campus.  That computer was
   designed in the early 70s and had about 132K of core memory and its
   processor ran around 25MHz.  How many simultaneous users logged in
   and doing stuff could that system support?

   About 1200.

   I attribute it to what I call the Walmart-ization of software.
   Software companies now target the mass market.  They're about
   beating competitors out to sweet spots.  Performance always takes a
   back seat to release speed.


4. What were some challenges in college you had to overcome? This
   can be in terms of picking a major, classes, clubs, social
   situations, or anything else that comes to mind.

   I got fired from a part-time job I had.  I worked for the CS
   department as a machine room operator.  I had been hired by a guy
   I really got along with, Al.  I was Al's first hire.  But as the
   number of machines grew and the amount of work to do, he had to hire
   more and more undergrad students.  I trained them all.  Eventually,
   he didn't want to manage the students so he transferred all of
   us over to a grad student in a different department, Jeff.  Jeff
   didn't know what we did or how we did it.  Unknown to me, he felt
   intimidated by me, because although he was technically my boss, he
   didn't understand anything I did and didn't like me.

   What I didn't know was that he didn't like me and was spreading flat
   out lies in staff meetings behind my back claiming I was doing a
   bunch of things I wasn't.

   Just before I got transferred, Al had gotten approval for one of
   the highest raises the department had ever given out to a student.
   A few weeks later, Jeff's boss' boss wanted to talk with me.  I
   thought it was to congratulate me on the raise and what a good job
   I had been doing and helping train everyone.  Nope, he fired me
   rattling off this long list of lies Jeff had spread.  I didn't even
   understand what most of them were let alone how to do them.

   Within minutes of being fired, Al approached me and rehired me under
   him back in his department.

   What that taught me was a job isn't just doing the work well.  You
   have to always be mindful of office politics.  When you do a job
   well, that builds your rep and influence.  Someone else is going to
   want that, so you're going to have someone unhappy with you.  Always
   keep that in mind.  Part of your job is being mindful of office
   politics and building alliances with those above you.

   BTW, I felt vendicated a few months later.  Both Jeff and the
   department head who fired me were both fired for incompetence.


5. What advice would you give to students pursuing a similar career
   path as you, or even engineering in general?

   Being an engineer, the work you do is primarily solving technical
   problems, but there's more to it than that.  Any job you do has
   what I consider 4 aspects to it: technical, managerial, legal, and
   political.

   Managerial is controlling people and resources.

   Legal is what laws your work falls under.  These could be criminal
   and/or civil statutes.  Usually at a minimum Intellectual Property
   law.

   And Politics.  Build your alliances and learn how to avoid torpedoes.

   Typically, other people will be directly handling managerial and
   legal, but you need to be aware of them and help those people out
   doing those roles for you.


6. Was there something in college you wished you could've done, that
   will be useful for students here to know about?

   I wish I would have started working on my soft skills all the way
   back in college.  Being an engineering geek, I completely ignored
   them thinking they weren't important.  Solving problems is only one
   aspect of your job.  Communication, public speaking, influence,
   leadership, interpersonal dynamics all matter more than you think.
   Work on them every chance you get.
