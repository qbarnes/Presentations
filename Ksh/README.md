This talk about Korn Shell was one of the first talks I ever gave in
my career.  I gave it back in the Fall of 1988 to my site when I was
still a new hire at Motorola.

I gave the Korn Shell talk several times to different groups inside
and outside the company.  This is the only copy of one of the Ksh
talks I gave that I could still find.

Why I made this talk was my site was originally a BSD shop, so
virtually everyone used `csh`.  I had just come from a company that
ran AT&T UNIX and used `ksh`.  The title of this talk, "The Korn
Shell: Don't Worry, it's in There", is a play on words from
[the old Prego spaghetti sauce ads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J87QekxQVI)
back in the day.

The engineers switching from Csh to Ksh were fearful that they'd
lose functionality.  I explained to them with a very poor Italian
accent, "Don't worry!  It's there!" letting them know that all the
functionalty they had relied on in Csh was there in Ksh, just
accessed differently.  I would sometimes refer to Ksh as "The Prego
Shell".

The months before the talk, I only knew Ksh a little and only then
from an occasional user's viewpoint.  However, after the site found
out I had previously used Ksh, I was deemed a de facto "expert".
That designation though became self-fulfilling.  All the questions
coming to me and all the answers I figured out for them over time
did eventually make me an actual expert.

That experience also taught me a trick.  One day someone came to me
with a Ksh question.  I was really busy and asked them to come
back in twenty minutes, I would help them then.  They did and
got their help.

Several weeks later, someone came to me with a another random
question, but I didn't know the answer off the top of my head.
However, I knew I could look it up and figure it out pretty quickly.
Remembering my previous experience, I told them I was busy and
asked them to come back in twenty minutes.  While they were gone, I
figured out a good answer for them.  When they came back, they got
the answer they needed and went away very pleased.  A nice trick I
would use for some people from time to time throughout my career.
Usually, though, I'd just say, "You know, I'm not sure.  Let's
figure it out together."
