In my talk, topics I'm planning to cover:

   *) General introduction to Kprobes,

   *) The special problems the ARM cores presented for implementing
      Kprobes on that architecture,

   *) Issues in the current Kprobes machine-independent and
      machine-dependent layers for multi-processor and real-time
      concerns,

   *) My ARM Kprobes implementation, design trade-offs in possible
      approaches, and how the final version addresses all the
      various concerns, and

   *) Some sample practical uses of Kprobes in an embedded
      environment with Q & A.
