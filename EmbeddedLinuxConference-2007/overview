Title: Kernel Probes for ARM
Description:

Kernel probes ("Kprobes") is a Linux 2.6 kernel feature that allows
dynamic breakpoints to be placed most anywhere in the kernel. These
breakpoints can be used on the fly to collect debugging and
performance information with minimal system impact.

To implement Kprobes, the kernel requires substantial code in the
machine-dependent layer. Before now, no code existed to support
Kprobes on the ARM platform. In developing Kprobes for ARM, due
to the the ARM's unusual architecture, it presented difficulties
previously unencountered and unresolved for any other platform.

Also, all current Kprobes implementations present problems for
real-time constraints on kernels configured for preemption. This
unique approach fully implements Kprobes for ARM solving the
existing implementation issues, is MP-safe, lightweight, and fits in
just a small amount of code space.
